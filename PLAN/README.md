## 🏗️ Deployment Type: VPS with Direct Deployment

### What This Means:
- **Hosting:** GoDaddy VPS (Virtual Private Server)
- **Deployment:** Direct (not containerized with Docker)
- **Process Manager:** PM2 (instead of Docker)
- **Architecture:** Nginx → PM2 → Node.js → MySQL

### Why Not Docker?
- Simpler for single-application deployment
- Better performance (no container overhead)
- Easier to debug and manage
- PM2 provides similar benefits (auto-restart, monitoring)

### Is It Different from Hostinger?
**Yes, slightly:**
- **Hostinger:** Docker containers
- **GoDaddy:** Direct PM2 deployment

**But the workflow is similar:**
```bash
# Same for both:
git push origin main          # Push code

# On server (Hostinger):
git pull && docker-compose restart

# On server (GoDaddy):
git pull && pm2 restart emma-cms
```
